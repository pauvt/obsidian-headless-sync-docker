# obsidian-headless-sync-docker

A minimal, rootless Docker image for continuously syncing an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault via [obsidian-headless](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-headless) — the official headless client for Obsidian Sync released February 2026.

Built on [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for proper process supervision, signal handling, and ordered service startup. The container starts as root to perform one-time user/group and ownership setup, then runs the main services as a non-root user.

**Requirements:** An active [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) subscription.

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1 — Get your auth token (one-time)

Pull the image and run the interactive login helper. It will prompt for your Obsidian email, password, and MFA code (if enabled), then print your token.

```bash
sudo docker run --rm -it --entrypoint get-token ghcr.io/pauvt/obsidian-headless-sync-docker:latest
```

Copy the printed `OBSIDIAN_AUTH_TOKEN` value — you'll need it in step 3.

> **Note:** The token persists until you explicitly log out or revoke it from your Obsidian account. You only need to run this once per machine (or per token rotation).

---

### Step 2 — Find your remote vault name (one-time)

List the vaults available on your Obsidian Sync account:

```bash
sudo docker run --rm \
  -e OBSIDIAN_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token-here \
  --entrypoint ob \
  ghcr.io/pauvt/obsidian-headless-sync-docker:latest \
  sync-list-remote
```

> **⚠️ Note:** Using `--entrypoint ob` bypasses s6-overlay and runs the command as root. This is fine for read-only operations like `sync-list-remote`, but avoid mounting config volumes with this method as it may create root-owned files that conflict with the unprivileged service.

Note the exact vault name — you'll use it in `VAULT_NAME`.

---

### Step 3 — Configure your environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in at minimum:

```env
OBSIDIAN_AUTH_TOKEN=<token from step 1>
VAULT_NAME=My Vault
VAULT_HOST_PATH=./vault
CONFIG_HOST_PATH=./config
```

See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for all options.

---

### Step 4 — Start continuous sync

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

On first run the container performs a one-time `ob sync-setup` to link the local directory to your remote vault, then enters continuous sync mode. Subsequent restarts skip the setup and go straight to syncing.

Watch logs:

```bash
sudo docker compose logs -f
```

---

## Architecture

This image uses [s6-overlay v3](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) as its init system. See [`docs/s6-overlay-design.md`](docs/s6-overlay-design.md) for the full design documentation.

The startup sequence runs through ordered s6-rc services:

1. **init-setup-user** — adjusts UID/GID to match `PUID`/`PGID`
2. **init-check-auth** — validates `OBSIDIAN_AUTH_TOKEN` is set
3. **init-obsidian-login** — runs `ob login` to authenticate
4. **init-setup-vault** — runs `ob sync-setup` and applies optional config
5. **svc-obsidian-sync** — starts `ob sync --continuous` under s6 supervision

If any init step fails, the container exits immediately (`S6_BEHAVIOUR_IF_STAGE2_FAILS=2`).

Supported platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`.

## File Ownership (PUID / PGID)

At startup the container adjusts its internal `obsidian` user to match the `PUID`/`PGID` you provide, then drops privileges via `s6-setuidgid` before running any Obsidian commands. This means vault files on the host are owned by the UID/GID you choose.

**Regular Docker** (daemon runs as root):

```bash
# Find your UID and GID
id
# uid=1000(you) gid=1000(you) ...
```

```env
PUID=1000
PGID=1000
```

---

## File Permissions (UMASK)

By default the container applies a umask of `0077`, which means synced vault files are only accessible to their owner — no group or other access.

| Value | Files | Dirs | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0077` | `rw-------` | `rwx------` | Default — owner only (recommended for NAS) |
| `0027` | `rw-r-----` | `rwxr-x---` | Owner + group read |
| `0022` | `rw-r--r--` | `rwxr-xr-x` | Everyone reads |

```env
UMASK=0077
```

---

## End-to-End Encryption (VAULT_PASSWORD)

Obsidian Sync supports optional end-to-end encryption with a separate vault password. If your vault has this enabled, `ob sync-setup` will fail to authenticate until the password is provided.

**To check:** In the Obsidian desktop app, go to **Settings → Sync** and look for an "Encryption password" field — if it's present and set, E2E is active.

Add the password to your `.env`:

```env
VAULT_PASSWORD=your-vault-encryption-password
```

> **Note:** `VAULT_PASSWORD` is the *vault encryption password* you chose in Obsidian, not your Obsidian account password. They are separate credentials.

> **⚠️ Passwords containing `$`:** Docker Compose interpolates `.env` files, so a bare `$` in the value (e.g. `pa$sword`) is treated as the start of a variable reference and silently stripped, truncating your password. If your password contains a `$`, wrap it in single quotes so Compose treats it literally:
>
> ```env
> VAULT_PASSWORD='pa$sword'
> ```

---

## Sync Configuration (SYNC_MODE / SYNC_CONFIGS)

These variables map directly to [`ob sync-config`](https://obsidian.md/help/sync/headless#%60ob+sync-config%60) options and are applied every time the container starts.

### SYNC_MODE

Controls how local and remote changes are reconciled.

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `bidirectional` | Upload local changes **and** download remote changes (default) |
| `pull-only` | Download remote changes only — local changes are ignored |
| `mirror-remote` | Download remote changes only — local changes are reverted |

```env
SYNC_MODE=pull-only
```

### SYNC_CONFIGS

Comma-separated list of Obsidian config categories to sync alongside vault notes. Leave blank to keep the vault's existing setting (all categories synced by default).

| Value | Syncs |
|---|---|
| `app` | Core app settings |
| `appearance` | Theme and appearance settings |
| `appearance-data` | Theme assets (CSS snippets, etc.) |
| `hotkey` | Keyboard shortcuts |
| `core-plugin` | Core plugin toggle states |
| `core-plugin-data` | Core plugin configuration data |
| `community-plugin` | Community plugin list and toggle states |
| `community-plugin-data` | Community plugin configuration data |

```env
# Sync only app settings and hotkeys
SYNC_CONFIGS=app,hotkey
```

For the full reference see the [obsidian-headless `ob sync-config` documentation](https://obsidian.md/help/sync/headless#%60ob+sync-config%60).

### CONFIG_DIR_NAME

Overrides the name of the Obsidian config directory inside the vault (default: `.obsidian`). Only needed if your vault uses a non-standard config directory name.

```env
CONFIG_DIR_NAME=.obsidian
```

## Using a Pre-Built Image vs. Building Locally

### Pre-built (recommended)

Images are published to the GitHub Container Registry on every push to `main` and on version tags. Multi-arch images are available for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

```yaml
# compose.yml already points to:
image: ghcr.io/pauvt/obsidian-headless-sync-docker:latest
```

### Build locally

```bash
sudo docker build -t obsidian-headless-sync-docker .
```

Then update `compose.yml` to use `image: obsidian-headless-sync-docker`.

---

## Updating the Image

```bash
sudo docker compose pull
sudo docker compose up -d
```

---

## Stopping

```bash
sudo docker compose down
```

Your vault files remain on disk at `VAULT_HOST_PATH`.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Container exits immediately**
- Check that `OBSIDIAN_AUTH_TOKEN` and `VAULT_NAME` are set: `sudo docker compose config`
- Check init logs: the container stops on any init failure (`S6_BEHAVIOUR_IF_STAGE2_FAILS=2`)

**"Vault not found" error on setup**
- Confirm the vault name matches exactly (case-sensitive): run `ob sync-list-remote` as shown in Step 2.

**"Failed to validate password" on setup**
- Your vault has end-to-end encryption enabled. Set `VAULT_PASSWORD` in `.env` to the encryption password from **Obsidian → Settings → Sync**. This is distinct from your Obsidian account password.
- If the password contains a `$` character, make sure it's wrapped in single quotes in `.env` (e.g. `VAULT_PASSWORD='pa$sword'`), otherwise Compose's variable interpolation will silently truncate it. Run `docker compose config` and check the resolved `VAULT_PASSWORD` value matches what you expect.

**Sync stops after a while**
- The `restart: unless-stopped` policy in `compose.yml` will restart the container automatically. Within the container, s6 supervises the sync process and restarts it if it exits.

**Token expired / login required**
- Re-run the `get-token` step, update `OBSIDIAN_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env`, and restart: `sudo docker compose up -d`

**Permission denied on vault files**
- The container adjusts its internal user to match `PUID`/`PGID` (default `1000:1000`). Set these in `.env` to match the host user who should own the files (`id` shows your values).
